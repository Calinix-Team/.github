## Welcome to Calinix Github

CalinixOS is a power-user-friendly GNU/Linux distribution based on the independently developed Arch Linux. Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the very latest cutting-edge software. However, Arch is also traditionally aimed at more experienced or technically-minded users as you have to install all your tools step by step writing tons of commands. Shan't be a proble for the power user but is a bit easier. CalinixOS is suitable for intermediate as well as experienced Linux users. For newcomers, a user-friendly installer is provided, and the system itself is designed to work fully“straight out of the box”
